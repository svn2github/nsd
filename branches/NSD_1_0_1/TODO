ZONE COMPILER
- memory allocation optimization is needed
- parser is too smart: should not try to continue processing if there are errors...
- as writing the zone the order should be DNS SEC compliant (use dnameinvert())
- missing closing quote doesnt register as an error

SERVER
- in tcp the timeout should be handled different than with alarm()?
- replace all ntohs(..) with #define .... something[i] and ntohs() it beforehand
- make sure that we dont copy anything from the query we dont want to copy, like
  funny headers etc
- add chroot() call submitted by Jakob

SECURITY

PURITY
- some data is in network order some in host order, make it clear with prefixes
- brush up the fuction and identifiers names
- bzero pads so the databases can be cmp'd

TESTS
- set all the buffer sizes to ridiculously small values see if it causes
  core dumps

MISC
- functions should be regroupped differently in .c files, so nsd-notify
  doesnt have to be linked with all the unnecessary stuff

1.0.1-RELEASE
- multiple strings in TXT records (done)
- different TTL (done)
- missing glue
- LOC record (done)
- WKS (low prio)
- axfr lock, rebuild lock in the scripts
- trailing garba .eunet.si (done)
- ip 255.255.255.255 fix (fixed) unless #define USE_INET_ADDR
