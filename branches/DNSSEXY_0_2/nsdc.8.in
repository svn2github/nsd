.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
.B Dnssexyc
is the shell script that used to control dnssexy(8) and zonec(8) from 
.B dnssexy
distribution.
.B Dnssexyc
is also suitable to be linked into
.I /etc/rc.d
directory on
.I BSD
like systems for automatic startup of dnssexy(8) at boot time.
.P
At every invokation,
.B dnssexyc
will try to read the dnssexy.conf(5) configuration file. An example of 
such configuration file is distributed with the
.B dnssexy
package as
.IR dnssexy.conf.sample .
The config file is checked for errors before it is used, see 
dnssexy\-checkconf(8).
.P
Possible
.B dnssexyc
applications are:
.TP
.I start
Start dnssexy(8).
.TP
.I stop
Shut down dnssexy(8) by sending 
.I SIGTERM 
to it. 
.TP
.I reload
Initiate dnssexy(8) name space database reload by sending
.IR SIGHUP.
.TP 
.I rebuild
Rebuild the dnssexy(8) database by invoking zonec(8) with appropriate 
arguments.
.TP 
.I restart
Restart dnssexyc(8). This equals to dnssexyc stop && dnssexyc start.
.TP
.I running
Check whether dnssexy(8) is running. Returns error message and error 
code if it is not running, and no message and zero error code 
otherwise. 
.TP
.I update
Updates all the slave zones which have
.I allow\-notify:
from localhost (127.0.0.1 or ::1) allowed.
If a TSIG key is specified for the allow\-notify statement in the 
config file, it will be used to secure the notify. Note that dnssexy
keeps track of zone timeouts automatically, this is only needed if 
you want to manually force updates by sending notify messages to the 
localhost. 
.P
.RS
Another method you can use is to stop dnssexy, delete the xfrd.state
file and then start dnssexy again. It will try to update all zones.
This method does not require allow\-notify: statements.
.RE
.TP
.I notify
Sends notify messages to all the slaves for all the zones that have the
.I notify:
keyword in the
.I dnssexy.conf
file. If a TSIG key is specified for a notify statement, it will be 
used to secure the notification message to that slave server.
.TP
.I patch
Merge zone transfer changes back to zone files. It reads in the dnssexy 
database (dnssexy.db) and difffile (ixfr.db), and overwrites the zone 
text files if they have been updated. Running this regularly 
ensures that the difffile does not grow infinitely. If any zone text
files have been changed (including those of the master zones), the
dnssexy.db is rebuild and dnssexy is reloaded.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-c\fI configfile
Specify configfile to use instead of the default
.IR @nsdconfigfile@ .
.SH "FILES"
.TP
@nsdconfigfile@
Configuration file for dnssexy to change default pathnames and
.B dnssexy
flags. The zone names, pathnames to zone files and access control 
lists are also in dnssexy.conf(5).
.TP
@dbfile@
default
.B dnssexy
database
.TP
@dbfile@.lock
Lockfile for the
.B dnssexy
database access by operator tools.
.TP
@difffile@
Journal of zone transfers, the diff file containing the new zone 
contents transferred.
.TP
@xfrdfile@
State for the zone transfer process of 
.BR dnssexy. 
Contains timeouts for the zones and whether zones are expired.
.TP
@pidfile@
the process id of the name server.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.LP
.B Dnssexyc
will return zero return code if operation was successful and
an error message to standard output plus a non\-zero return code
otherwise.

.SH "BUGS"
Syntax checking of the config file is rudimentary and error 
messages may be wrong. If you do a dnssexyc patch, whilst a (long) zone 
transfer is busy, the zone transfer contents will be partially 
lost. After a reload, this will be detected and the zone transfer 
should be restarted. The reload that happens at the end of dnssexyc 
patch also frees up memory churn in 
.B dnssexy
caused by zone transfers.
